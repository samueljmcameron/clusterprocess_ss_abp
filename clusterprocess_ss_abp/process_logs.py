    """
    
    Check multiple runs of a log type of data,
    and keep a record of those runs which were missed or
    incorrectly formatted due to being cancelled by the job
    scheduler.

    Parameters
    ----------
    basename : string
        First part of the file name (prior to the run
        number). If it includes the phrase 'HERE', then
        this bit will be replaced with phrases from runstarts
        keyword below.
    eof : string
        Second part of the file name (after the run number).
    runslist : 1D array like of ints
        List of runs to scan over.
    outputs : list of strings (optional)
        Names of the computes that are in the thermo output.
        Default is ['c_pairpress','c_pfd'].
    runstarts : 1D list of strings (optional)
        Strings to insert in basename for each different run.
        Length of list should be same as runslist length above.
        Default is None.
    t_start : integer (optional)
        A single start time for all the different runs. Necessary if
        the runs all start at different times to average correctly
        (assuming same end time and time spacing). Default is -1.

    Returns
    -------
    finaldict : dictionary
        Contains average values for the different log quantities,
        as well as other useful information that is shared by all
        runs scanned over.
    missed_runs : list of ints
        Every time a data file from a specific run is missing, the
        run number is appended to this list.
